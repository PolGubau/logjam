### Copy Recommended VSCode Settings

To align your VSCode settings with the project's recommended configuration:

1. Navigate to the `.vscode` directory at the root of the project.
2. Copy the `settings.json.sample` file and rename the copy to `settings.json`.
3. If desired, customize the `settings.json` with your personal preferences.
